Home Discover Changi Free things to see and do at Changi Airport for a day of fun Family-friendly things to do at Changi Airport for a day of fun 19 Apr 2023 By Ezza Hani It’s every parent’s dilemma to decide on meaningful activities to entertain their children on weekends. We have some suggestions for you - from play to eat - all under one roof. So what’s there to see and do at Changi Airport, even with nowhere to fly off to? As it turns out, plenty. From whizzing down Singapore’s tallest slide to walking with life-sized dinosaurs, a host of activities await your patronage at Changi. Here's how to spend a day of fun at Changi Airport: A prehistoric safari along Jurassic Mile Don't miss the photogenic Hub & Spoke cafe while you're visiting the Jurassic Mile. A fun treat for dino-loving kids, expect to catch a glimpse of 31 colourful prehistoric exhibits in total, including the long-necked Brontosaurus and everyone’s fearsome favourite Tyrannosaurus Rex. They’re not playing around with these towering models either — the tallest dinosaur stands at nearly 5 metres high! The Jurassic Park experience is enhanced by the bevvy of information panels filled with factoids on these majestic creatures. Plenty of photo opportunities abound, of course. Afterall, it is Singapore’s largest permanent outdoor display of dinosaurs! While you're here, you can also cycle or jog to East Coast or Marina Bay on the Changi Airport Connector , which has recently bagged several awards including two at the SG Mark 2021 Award for its design. Location : Outside Terminal 4. Follow the signs to Jurassic Mile after dropping off at the Terminal 4 Arrival pick up point or carpark 4A. Enter the world of aviation at the Changi Experience Studio Ever wondered how the world’s best airport is run? Embark on a journey of fun and discovery through amazing projection experiences, interactive games and immersive shows. In this first-of-its-kind digital attraction, experience the magic of technology and see what goes behind the scenes at Changi Airport. Be an airport staff for a day and try out baggage sorting, handling trolleys, coordinating taxis and doing security screenning of baggage for prohibited items. End off the digital experience and enjoy an immersive video of Changi Airport’s future through time and space. Purchase your tickets here . Location : Changi Experience Studio, Level 4 of Jewel Changi Airport. The height of delight at The Slide@T3 Here's one for the little ones! Dare you enter the world’s tallest slide in an airport? Measuring 4 storeys high, you’d be forgiven if you’re a little hesitant to go on a breathtaking ride on The Slide@T3 , where you’ll be zooming downwards from Level 1 to Basement 3. It’s fun for all ages at the speed of six metres per second, as long as you’re between 1.3 to 2 metres in height. Entering the slide is free of charge — you’ll just have to first sign up for a (free) Changi Rewards membership to redeem for 10 rides. Flash your Changi Rewards e-card at Basement 2’s customer service counter to redeem! Location : Level 1 or Basement 2 of Terminal 3 Defy gravity at Changi’s new rock climbing attraction For the active ones, let them try out bouldering or rock climbing. Need to expend the children’s energy? This might just be the activitiy for you. Climb@T3 is a new 8-metre rock-climbing wall at Terminal 3 suitable for climbers of all ages and abilities. There’s also a 12-metre boulder wall for the younger ones, age 3 to 6 years old, to try out. This family-friendly attraction provides both guided and free-and-easy programmes for climbers of varying skill levels. Time to put those muscles and energy to good use and have a good workout! Charges apply. Book your slots here. Location : Terminal 3, Basement 2. Silver screen sensations at ST3PS In case you’re wondering about it, ST3PS is a play on the word “steps” (because it’s a stepped amphitheatre) combined with the fact that it’s located at Terminal 3. Regardless, just know that ST3PS is all about communal (but socially distanced) entertainment! Head down to Basement 2, find yourself a cosy spot on the platforms, and settle in for hours on end in front of a massive ultra high-definition screen that plays blockbuster movies daily, from day to night. Who says you’d have to splurge for a movie outing with the family? Movies are screened for absolutely free daily. If you’re up for it, you could even hold a binge-watching session and spend an entire day there just blitzing through multiple flicks. Be sure to check out t"
